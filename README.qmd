# Monash Exam Format Template

This is a Quarto template that assists you in creating an exam for Monash University.

## Creating a new exam

You can use this as a template to create a exam.
To do this, use the following command:

```bash
quarto use template quarto-monash/exam
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your exam.

## Installation for existing document

You may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document.
From the quarto project or document directory, run the following command to install this format:

```bash
quarto install extension quarto-monash/exam
```

## Example

[![](examples/template.png)](examples/template.pdf)

## Solution toggle and answer fields

This extension supports solution blocks that display differently based on rendering mode:

- **Exam mode** (default): Solution content is hidden and replaced with answer boxes
- **Solution mode** (`-M solution:true`): Solutions are displayed with styled formatting

### Usage

```markdown
::: {.solution box=4}
Your solution content here with point markers \p \pp
:::
```

### Rendering commands

```bash
# Render exam sheet (solutions hidden, answer boxes shown)
quarto render template.qmd -M solution:false

# Render solution sheet (solutions visible)
quarto render template.qmd -M solution:true

# Render with blank answer boxes (no grid)
quarto render template.qmd -M solution:false -M grid-paper:false
```

### Answer field sizing

- `box=X` - Creates an answer field of X cm height in exam mode
- If `box` is omitted, height is auto-estimated from solution content

### Point markers

Use point markers inside solution blocks for grading annotations:

- `\p` - 1 point
- `\hp` - 0.5 points (half point)
- `\pp` - 2 points (double points)

In solution mode, these display as red superscripts (e.g., `^[1P]`). In exam mode, they are invisible.

### YAML options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `solution` | Show solutions instead of answer boxes | `false` |
| `grid-paper` | Show 5mm grid in answer boxes | `true` |
| `answerfields` | Show answer boxes in exam mode | `true` |
