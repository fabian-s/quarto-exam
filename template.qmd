Show that the following expression is the MLE for the variance assuming a Gaussian distribution.
$$ \hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{x})^2$$

::: {.solution box=6}
**Solution:**

We maximize the log-likelihood: \p
$$\ell(\mu, \sigma^2) = -\frac{n}{2}\log(2\pi) - \frac{n}{2}\log(\sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\mu)^2$$ \pp

Taking the derivative with respect to $\sigma^2$ and setting to zero: \p
$$\frac{\partial \ell}{\partial \sigma^2} = -\frac{n}{2\sigma^2} + \frac{1}{2(\sigma^2)^2}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\mu)^2 = 0$$ \pp

Solving gives $\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar{x})^2$ \p
